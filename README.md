# Level-Up Back-End

CRUD out the Level Up application

## Description
Create a personal account that saves your video game collection for
your eyes only.

Each user has the ability to:
  - Add a game!: New purchase? Add it! Forgotten PS1 games lying
    around? Forget no more, Add'em here!
  - Update a game: "Vrash Bandicoot"? Easily fix up the mistake
    with a quick update.
  - Delete a game: Hate a game so much you wish you never owned it?
    Well after you trade, sell or burn it, delete the game out of
    your collection.

Level Up allows the user to keep track of their collection whether
they are located digitally on the system, neatly stacked on a
bookcase or stored in an old shoe box.

No more do you have to wonder what games you own. Level Up is here to help you level up your gaming organization. YEA!

## Idea Behind the Game (Planning)
I am a video game addict. I most likely have too many systems and
games that even I lose track of. Which is where the idea for this
application came from.

My initial plan for this project was to create an app where a user
can keep track of which video game systems they own. Then based off
those systems, they can log each game, both physical and digital
copy, to match each system. Once they log all the data in, they
will be able to search through their personal collection and view
what they own and what they may want to play.

For me personally, I do enjoy this idea because whenever company is
over it becomes a time consuming process to figure out the
question, "What should we play?" With the app, I would be able to
search my collection by whether or not a game has multiplayer, and
then by how many controllers are owned for each system. Also
throwing in a randomly generated video game choice makes deciding a
lot easier.

The beginning stages of planning went well with the creation of my wireframes and tables. Knowing exactly what I would want as a user also helped because, as mentioned, it is an app I would like to use.

I was unable to proceed with the system connection for this project but looking forward to accomplish that in a later update. SO, i shrank the scope to just focus on the video games themselves. Each game can include:
  - Name
  - Developer
  - Year it came out
  - Copy (digital/physical)
  - System the game is owned for
  - Multiplayer capability

With the gaming world ever growing I didn't want to include too
much needed data to fill in. Maybe hooking up to a third party API
that consist of all video games ever made will help make this app
more accessible.

Going into this app I knew it's something already out on the
market, but I feel once it's all together, it can separate itself
from the crowd.

## Future Fixes
- MAKE WORK DRY!!!!!
- add systems route
- add randomizer route
- update search route to cover all


## User Stories
- As a user, I want to view my whole video game collection

- As a user, I want to view my video game collection by specific
  paramaters
- As a user, I want to delete from my collection
- As a user, I want to have the app generate a random video game
- As a user, I don't want others to be able to view my collection
- As a user, I don't want others to be able to delete my collection
